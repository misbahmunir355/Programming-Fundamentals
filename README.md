**Image Filtering using C++ (PGM Images)**

This repository contains a Programming Fundamentals mini project that performs basic image processing on grayscale PGM (P2 format) images.

The program loads image data using file handling, processes it using mean and median filtering techniques, and saves the modified image back to disk. A menu-driven interface allows easy interaction with different image operations.


**Key Concepts:** 

C++, File I/O, 2D Vectors, Image Processing
